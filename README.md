Online Shopping 
This project appears to be a web-based shopping cart implementation. 
The provided code defines functions to add items to the shopping cart, remove items from the cart, and update the cart display on a webpage. 
It keeps track of the shopping cart items in an array (shoppingCart) and calculates the total price of the items. 
The addToCart() function adds a new item to the cart and updates the display, 
while the removeFromCart() function removes a specific item from the cart and updates the display accordingly. 
The updateCartDisplay() function dynamically updates the HTML elements showing the cart items and total price.
The removeAllItems() function clears the entire cart by resetting the array and total price to zero. 
Overall, this code provides basic functionality for managing a shopping cart on a web page
